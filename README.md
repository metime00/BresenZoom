BresenZoom
==========

Bresenham line and circle algorithms, just practicing F# libraries

Controls:
left click and drag = draw a basic line
right click and drag = draw a circle with origin where mouse was pressed, edge where mouse released
middle mouse click = clear the screen
ctrl + middle click = memoize the screen (very laggy to calculate for the whole screen)
ctrl + right click = draw line of sight in circle from where the mouse was clicked
alt + left click and drag = draw continuously
